# Repeated Word Challenge

## Author: Sarah Shatto

## Assignment

- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.

- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Structure and Testing:

- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
